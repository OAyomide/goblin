Goblin
Goblin it the source code for the [Building a simple bot using Go](https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-simple-echo-bot-in-go-part-1-5de347bdf2b0?source=your_stories_page---------------------------) series.

Also, this project actually serves as a kind of guinea pig for the [Planned framework](https://github.com/oayomide/go-jack). The idea is to use this as the building block and try out new things before being written on the framework proper


The project assumes some ideas working with Golang and of course, big ‚ù§Ô∏è writing bots. The project is also quite untidy for now --for obvious reasons.

##### Short term TO-DO:

1. [x] Split into packages
2. [ ] Allow bot listen for regex
3. [ ] Support other messenger APIs (Typing indicator, Message read, etc)

###### Much love is appreciate and this project is quite more maintained than many other projects on my github üòÑ
